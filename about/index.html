                <h2>What is Baja SAE?</h2>
                <p>
                    Baja SAE is an international collegiate design competition in which student teams design, 
                    build, test, and race a single-seat off-road vehicle. Teams follow strict SAE rules and 
                    compete in both static and dynamic events that evaluate design quality, manufacturability, 
                    cost analysis, and real-world performance. Vehicles are pushed through demanding endurance 
                    courses featuring steep hills, large obstacles, deep ruts, and extended run times that 
                    emphasize durability and reliability.
                    
                    Through Baja SAE, students experience a complete engineering design cycle, applying classroom 
                    knowledge to real-world challenges while developing skills in mechanical design, manufacturing, 
                    testing, and problem-solving.

                <h2>Who We Are</h2>
                <p>
                    Founded in 1978, Clemson Baja SAE is a student-run undergraduate engineering organization that designs, 
                    manufactures, and competes with custom-built off-road vehicles in the Baja SAE Collegiate Design Series.
                    Our team is built on innovation, teamwork, and hands-on learning, bringing together students from a variety 
                    of engineering and technical backgrounds.

                    Members collaborate to design and manufacture nearly every major subsystem of the vehicle in-house, including 
                    the frame, suspension, steering, brakes, and drivetrain. Beyond technical development, the team manages budgeting,
                    sponsor relations, project scheduling, and outreach, providing members with experience that closely mirrors 
                    professional engineering and industry environments.

                <h2>Our History & Revival</h2>
                <p>
                    Clemson Baja SAE has represented Clemson University on an international stage for decades, carrying
                    forward a tradition of creativity and engineering excellence. Like many student organizations, the
                    team experienced a period of inactivity during the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2023, Clemson Baja SAE was 
                    revived by a small group of eight dedicated students determined to rebuild the program from the ground up.

                    Since then, the team has grown to over 30 active members and has returned to competition. In recent seasons,
                    Clemson Baja SAE has competed at events such as SAE Carolina, earning a 34th-place overall finish out of 65 
                    teams, marking a significant step in the team’s ongoing growth and return to competitive excellence.

                <h2>Looking Ahead</h2>
                <p>
                    As Clemson Baja SAE continues to grow, our focus remains on strengthening team culture, passing down technical
                    knowledge, and building a sustainable, competitive program. With the support of our sponsors and partners, we 
                    aim to expand competition participation, enhance vehicle performance, and provide meaningful hands-on engineering 
                    experience that prepares our members for careers in industry and beyond.
